        <h2 class="intro">Sinharaja forest, best place for a jungle expedition</h2>
        <p class="intropara">Sinharaja forest is the biggest rainforest in Sri Lanka, with different kinds of plants and animals, which most of them (around 60%) are endemic.Also, a variety of animals, birds, butterflies, and reptiles live in there. When it comes to the floral diversity, most of trees have a canopy structue. 
            
            
            All these species are characteristic of low and mid-elevation primary rainforests. Ephiphytic mosses and liverworts, orchids and ferns, some of them extremely rare, adorn the floor of the forests as well as the tree trunks, confirming yet again the good health of the forest.
            
            The Sinharaja Forest Reserve represents Sri Lanka’s only rainforest and is a living repository of a pristine ecosystem. The forest’s high biodiversity includes flora endemic to the country as well as some endemic to the forest itself.
            
            Baseline studies conducted by USAID with reputed environmentalists Prof. Sarath Kotagama and Prof. Nimal Gunatilleke on fauna and flora around the lodge area are available.
            
            Many rare and globally threatened species of fauna and flora underscore the reason why Sinharaja is a Man and Biosphere Forest Reserve and enjoys the status of a World Heritage Site.
            
            The Rainforest ecolodge which consists of 16 Chalets is located at the border of the Sinharaja World Heritage Site. Therefore many endemic and globally threatened species have been recorded and can be observed in and around the area.</br>
            
            Eg: Sri Lanka Blue Magpie, Loris Massmulla, Giant Squirrel, Toque Monkey, Fishing Cat, And Asian Elephant.</p>

The Sri Lankan elephant population is now largely restricted to the dry zone in the north, east and southeast of Sri Lanka. Elephants are present in Udawalawe National Park, Yala National Park, Lunugamvehera National Park, Wilpattu National Park and Minneriya National Park but also live outside protected areas. It is estimated that Sri Lanka has the highest density of elephants in Asia. Human-elephant conflict is increasing due to conversion of elephant habitat to settlements and permanent cultivation.</td>

However, as you move towards higher altitude areas in Sri Lanka, the sightings of these deer will remain rare. <br>Spotted Deer have a pinkish brown coat marked with white spots and the under parts of this animal remain white in color. Unlike females, the male species grow antlers, which are shed once a year. Usually, the antlers have three prongs and are curved in a lyre shape. When male spotted deer are at their prime during breeding, these antlers can extend to a whopping two and a half feet in length</td>

Pound for pound, it is the strongest climber of the larger cats and is capable of killing prey far larger than itself. However, the leopard is the smallest member of the genus Panthera, which includes the Lion, Tiger and Jaguar. Sadly, the range has decreased radically due to over hunting and loss of habitat. <br>Though the Sri Lanka leopard is classified as endangered, leopards can be more easily observed in Sri Lanka than in any other Asian country. One reason is: leopards  tend to be more hiding due to the existence of larger preditors. But there are neither tigers nor lions in Sri Lanka that could frighten leopards. So it is comparatively easy tp see a one.Yala is reputed for most spottings of leopards.
