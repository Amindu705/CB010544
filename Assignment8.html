            <p class="para">Sigiriya, also called Lion Rock or Lion Mountain, site in central Sri Lanka consisting of the ruins of an ancient stronghold that was built in the late 5th century CE on a remarkable monolithic rock pillar. The rock, which is so steep that its top overhangs the sides, rises to an elevation of 1,144 feet (349 metres) above sea level and is some 600 feet (180 metres) above the surrounding plain.</p>

    <p class="para">The Sinhalese king Kashyapa I (reigned 477–495) built a palace in the shape of a monumental lion on the several acres of ground at the summit, intending it to be a safeguard against his enemies. However, the king was defeated in 495, and the palace fell into ruin. The site soon became a pilgrimage destination, however, and it is now a popular tourist spot. Visitors begin the final ascent to the top through the open paws of the lion, one of the few remaining portions of the palace that are still intact. Also notable are 21 rock paintings of apsaras (celestial singers and dancers). Sigiriya was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1982.</p>

        <h2>Water fountains in Sigiriya</h2>

    <section class="grid-container">
        <section class="para"><p>Sigiriya water fountains work with the water pressure and the gravitational force of the planet earth. So that was a simple design to implement but the creators have done a miracle here. Those builders used underline pipe system to produce the water pressure. So they built this system from highland to low land to get the high water flowing speed using the earth’s gravity. Firstly, they made the Sigiriya tank and then used it as the primary water resource of the King.

            Secondly, they used that water to fill the inner moat and the outer moat. Then they made a canal to get the water to the moat which lies around the summer palace. Finally, they made a canal system to flow the water through the water garden from that moat.

            When can you see the water fountains
        </h1>

        <p class="para">It needs more water pressure to activate these famous Sigiriya water fountains. That means the water level is a key factor here. Sri Lanka has only two seasons. They are the summer season and the rainy(monsoon) season. Sigiriya has located in the dry zone of Sri Laka and the average rainfall is 1000mm-2000mm. The North-East monsoon is the basic rain monsoon around Sigiriya area.

            The North-East monsoon generally activated during the December to February. During that time the water level of the Sigiriya lake goes high. So the best season of the Sigiriya water fountains is from December to February. During the rainy season, it is one of the most beautiful scenes in Sigiriya.</p>
